# Mandala Drawer
## Project Description:
Madala drawer is able to draw  circles,square and others geometrical shapes. User can select from the keypad to draw a specific shape.
Two servo motors make it possible to draw objects on a piece of paper.

## Components Required:
1.	Arduino UNO
2.	Bread Board
3.	Two servo motors
4.	Jumper wires 
5.	Pen
6.	Keypad
7.	Small spring (from any old ballpoint)
8.	A tube of diammeter larger than the pen.
